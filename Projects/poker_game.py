ASSIGNMENT
For this assignment we are going to (also) create a poker game. 
The game needs to do the following:
    
Needs to be written on a file named poker_game.py
The game can be played by running python poker_game.py NUMBER_OF_PLAYERS
The script accepts an argument number_of_players which is a 
number indicating the number of players.
For each player the script will ask the name (using input() function).
The script will deal 5 cards to each player (you can use random.choice 
to select at random from a list). 
The different cards, sorted from lowest to highest are 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A. 
There are four suits, clubs, spades, hearts, diamonds.
The script will print out each one of the players' hand, find out which one of 
the players have a winning hand and will print out the name of the winner
For the winning rules, there are two possible implementations:
Easy version, where we just compare the hands and the hand with the highest 
cards wins. For example, if Player 1 has the hand 2,3,K,Q,7 and Player 2 has 
the hand 8,10, ACE,J,2 Player 2 would win because 1 ACE beats a K. If Player 1
 has the hand 2,3,K,Q,7, and Player 2 has the hand J,J,K,7,3 then Player 1 
 would win (since K,Q beats K,J).
Hard version, where we implement the different poker hands taking the suits 
into account (flush, poker, straight, etc).
hint: You can use the __gt__ , __lt__ or __eq__ methods on a class to implement
 comparisons (greater than, less than).

Finally, we will create a repository on github called poker_game, 
upload the poker_game.py file and a README.md file explaining what the game does. 
Then we will link the repository on the blog post.
